**Privacy Policy**

JVR Software built the CodeDroid app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by JVR Software at no cost and is intended for use as is.

At this moment, the app is only available for download on GitHub. In the future, we plan to make it available on Google Play, at which point additional privacy terms for Google Play will be included in this policy.

This project is a continuation of the original CodeAssist project, which was initially developed by the previous owner, Tyron (username: tyron12233). However, JVR Software now maintains and updates the project under the new name **CodeDroid**.
